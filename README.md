The Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source, meta-operating system designed to provide a structured framework for robotics software development. It offers a collection of tools and libraries to help in creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. ROS facilitates hardware abstraction, low-level device control, and implementation of commonly-used functionality, which streamlines the process of building and programming robots. It's widely used in research and industry, providing a rich set of capabilities for robot developers
