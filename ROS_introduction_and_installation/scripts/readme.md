# ROS Installation Script

This Bash script automates the installation process for ROS (Robot Operating System) on your Ubuntu machine. It is specifically written for ROS `Noetic`.

## Dependencies

* Ubuntu 20.04

## Install

1. Open a terminal window and grant executable permissions to the script:

    ```
    chmod +x ros.sh
    ```
2. Run the script
    ```
    ./ros.sh
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Congratulations! ROS is now installed on your machine.



**Note:** The script assumes a standard `ROS Desktop Full` installation. If you have specific requirements, you may need to customize the script accordingly.
